    <p>In our cornerstone post on <a href='#' alt='Read more about Omnichannel'>What Is Omnichannel</a>,
      we discussed how a shopper’s personal data could conceivably live across brands. And perhaps
      that idea sounds strange at first, to suggest that companies share their data with the
      competition. But, as we said then, “the idea that retailers can stop people from shopping
      across brands or devices is mocked each time a bar code was scanned in a store to check
      competitors’ pricing.”</p>
